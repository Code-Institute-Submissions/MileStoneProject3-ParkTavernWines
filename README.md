# MileStone Project Three- Park Tavern South African Wine List

A useful data centric website. I am designing a website based on the extensive South African wines the we
offer at the Park Tavern pub in the heart of Southfields. I actually work at the pub and have a great
passion for wine and particularly South African coming from there originaly. I feel this will be a very
useful tool especially over lockdown where we have time to get our guest's to write reviews, especially 
well we are still offering deliveries for wines under current restrictions. As well as a useful time for 
staff members to update their knowledge base and allows them to take time to review the wines. A wise 
person once told me knowledge is power, so I will leave you with that thought well I get on with my website.

### Wireframes
Below I have 2 different Wireframes in order to ensure the design of my project works responsively. 
These were of course the initial design and a few parts have changed due to practicality and more realistic
when visualy looking at the end product.The medium and desktop are the same as it was only smaller 
devices where it had to be changed. Both are in the same folder. 

#### DESKTOP
[Desktop WireFrames](MS3 Wireframes.bmpr)

#### MOBILE 
[Mobile WireFrames]()

### Color scheme
I have chosen the color scheme that fits with the current website design of Park Tavern SW18 to allow 
fluidity of the site. The colors are neutral and easy on the eye. See the image below for the colors 
used throughout my site.

### Typogrophy
When looking at the typrogrophy of the website I would have liked to explore a few different options but
decided to keep the "Sans-serif" font from google fonts as this is used on the main Park Tavern website 
as when my feature is added I wanted it to keep fluidity and ensure it works professionaly.

## Features

### Search Wines By color
We have an extensive amount of wines so to categorize and allow our user to search by color 
means it makes it easier to navigate around the page. Then to click on each individual wine to 
get more information and a picture of it too.


### More information
A page dedicated to each wine showing their description, price range, region they are from.
Basically allowing our customers to learn more about the wine that they may want to drink.

## Features Left to Implement
I have a few features left to implement and these are as follows.
### 
I would like to add a few more features such as get all reviews to show under each wine.
### 
Get a star rating for each wine and see which ones are our users favorites.
